                Security appliances are specialized hardware devices designed to protect networks, systems, and data from various cyber threats. These appliances act as the first line of defense in an organization’s cybersecurity infrastructure, performing critical functions like traffic filtering, threat detection, and automated response to attacks. By leveraging these devices, organizations can enhance their security posture and ensure continuous monitoring and protection of their digital assets. Below is a list of commonly used security appliances in modern cybersecurity strategies:

                <p class="appliance-description">
                    A firewall is a security device or software that acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network, such as the internet. It monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules, blocking unauthorized access while allowing legitimate communication.
